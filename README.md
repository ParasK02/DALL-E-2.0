# DALL-E-2.0
Open AI has gained incredible popularity with its applications such as Chat GPT, and DALL-E. This web application is an improved version of DALL-E where it incorporates a community space where users can share their AI-generated images and the prompt used. The is a full stack app using React Js, Tailwind CSS, Express Js, MongoDB and Node Js along with Cloudinary to store the generated images in the backend.
