# DALL-E-2.0
Open AI has gained incredible popularity with its applications such as Chat GPT, and DALL-E. This web application is an improved version of DALL-E where it incorporates a community space where users can share their AI-generated images and the prompt used.

## Installation / Usage 

Make sure to have [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. Use the package manager to run the website using developer mode. 

```bash
npm run dev
```
My API calls from OpenAI API ran out :( you can replace it with your own if you'd like to test.
